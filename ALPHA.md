# Alpha Development version of Rotorflight-2.0 (4.3.x)

This is a snapshot of the ongoing Rotorflight 4.3 development.
It is called _ALPHA_ because lots of things are broken.

## Configuration

### Hardware Config

Should be the same as RF-1.0

All hardware related CLI commands (dump hardware) should work.

### Features


### Modes / AUX

The CLI commands are the same, but the range (PWM) resolution
has been incresed from 25 to 5us.


### Adjustment Functions

Adjustment functions have been totally rewritten, and have
very different functionality.


### Gyro Filterings

Most gyro filtering related CLI commands have been renamed in BF4.3
There are further changes in Rotorflight.

CLI commands listed below.

set gyro_decimation_hz = 250
set gyro_lpf1_type = BIQUAD
set gyro_lpf1_static_hz = 150
set gyro_lpf1_dyn_min_hz = 25
set gyro_lpf1_dyn_max_hz = 200
set gyro_lpf2_type = PT1
set gyro_lpf2_static_hz = 0
set gyro_notch1_hz = 0
set gyro_notch1_cutoff = 0
set gyro_notch2_hz = 0
set gyro_notch2_cutoff = 0
set dterm_lpf1_type = PT1
set dterm_lpf1_static_hz = 15
set dterm_lpf1_dyn_min_hz = 0
set dterm_lpf1_dyn_max_hz = 0
set dterm_lpf2_type = PT1
set dterm_lpf2_static_hz = 0
set dterm_notch_hz = 0
set dterm_notch_cutoff = 0


### Blackbox

Blackbox has been refactored in BF4.3, and further in RF2.0.

#### blackbox_mode

#### blackbox_sample_rate

Blackbox sampling is now locked to the PID loop, and can be reduced
by a factor of 2,4,8,16,32,64.


#### blackbox_log_

set blackbox_log_command = ON
set blackbox_log_setpoint = ON
set blackbox_log_control = ON
set blackbox_log_pid = ON
set blackbox_log_gyro_raw = ON
set blackbox_log_gyro = ON
set blackbox_log_acc = ON
set blackbox_log_mag = OFF
set blackbox_log_baro = ON
set blackbox_log_battery = ON
set blackbox_log_rssi = ON
set blackbox_log_rpm = ON
set blackbox_log_motors = ON
set blackbox_log_servos = ON
set blackbox_log_gps = OFF


### Debug

Debug has now 8x 32bit values, rather than 4x 16bit values.

Some debug modes are logging only one axis, which is selected
by debug_axis parameter.


### Sensors

New settings for sensor update speed:

set vbat_update_hz = 100
set ibat_update_hz = 100
set esc_sensor_update_hz = 100


### Profile (PID Profile)

Many profile settings have been renamed or changed.
